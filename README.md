My project is dedicated to ecology, or rather the sale of products related to the theme of Zero Waste. I named the project Green Jungle, representing the spirit of this movement. Thanks to projects like Green Jungle, anyone can get closer to non-waste consumption and co-existence with nature, so I think that my project is very important.

The site allows you to purchase everyday goods, which are divided into categories for convenience.

The project is localized into two languages: Russian and English.
